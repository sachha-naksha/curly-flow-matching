## Description

<div align="left">

**Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM)** is a new flow matching framework for learning non-gradient field dynamics by solving non-zero drift Schrödinger Bridge (SB) problem. In contrast, traditional flow-based generative models such as Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) commonly rely on least action objectives modeling gradient field dynamics. As a result, they struggle to represent inherently rotational, cyclical, or periodic behavior in data.

In natural sciences, most processes undergo non-gradient field dynamics. One such example is the cell cycle, where cells follow periodic trajectories in gene expression space, as revealed by RNA velocity. Curly-FM can recover such cyclical dynamics across cell cycle data, developmental trajectories, ocean currents, and turbulent flows, unlike widely-used trajectory inference baselines such as CFM and OT-CFM. We study both single marginal (acess to $p_0$ and $p_1$) and multi-marginal (access to $p_{t, t\in[0,1]}$) settings. 

Curly-FM is a simple two-stage framework. First, we learn neural bridges between marginal distributions by training a neural interpolant to match the drift of a chosen reference process. Second, we estimate the transport plan by computing a coupling that minimizes the discrepancy between the induced drifts, and then train the model using marginal flow matching objective.

This repo contains all elements needed to reproduce our results. See [this http link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26645) for the paper.

The preprocessed data can be downloaded here:
* [Preprocessed cell cycle data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kpetrovicc/curly-fm-cell-cycles/resolve/main/fibroblast_velocity.h5ad) which contains gene expressions and RNA velocities
* [Preprocessed oceans data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kpetrovicc/curly-fm-oceans/resolve/main/oceans.npz) which contains particle positions and velocities
* [Preprocessed mouse erythroid data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kpetrovicc/curly-fm-mouse-erythroid/resolve/main/cells.h5ad) which contains gene expressions and RNA velocities across multiple marginals
* [Pre-processed CFD data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kpetrovicc/curly-fm-cfd/resolve/main/2DTGV.zip)

The raw data can be downloaded here: [Raw cell cycle data](https://zenodo.org/records/4719436) and [Raw mouse erythroid data](https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/scvelo.datasets.gastrulation_erythroid.html). For usability, we provide the notebook [cell_data.ipynb](notebooks/cell_data.ipynb) which contain code for the data preprocessing, and code for data visualizations.

When adding the downloaded data to the repo make sure to create a `data/` folder to save the downloaded datasets. For CFD the data should be saved under `data/CFD/2DTGV`. 💡 Remember to also change the data directory names in dataloader configs and notebooks.
